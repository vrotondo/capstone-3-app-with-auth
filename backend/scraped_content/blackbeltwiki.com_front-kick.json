  "description": "This page provides details on the martial arts front kick. While a front kick is a basic kick, it is useful for self-defense situations such as kicking an attacker in the groin. Most basic front kicks either hit the target with the top of the foot or the ball of the foot. FYI – In Karate, a front kick is known as Mae Geri. In Taekwondo, a front kick is known as Ap Chagi. For information on other martial arts kicks (i.e. spinning hook kick), please visit Black Belt Wiki’s main section on Martial Arts Kicks.\n\nMartial arts kicks and all other martial arts techniques should only be practiced under the supervision of a trained martial arts instructor in order to prevent injuries and to ensure the proper technique is utilized. In addition, all martial arts techniques and training should be used safely and responsibly.\n\nFront Kick Variations",
