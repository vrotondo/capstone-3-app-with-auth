  "description": "This page provides free instructions & videos for color belt Taekwondo forms and black belt Taekwondo forms. You will need to learn these Taekwondo forms in order to be awarded your next level Taekwondo belt. This Black Belt Wiki section examines the Taegeuk forms used by World Taekwondo (WT), one of the two largest Taekwondo organizations. However, if you are looking for information on the patterns used by the International Taekwondo Federation (the other main Taekwondo organization), please go to our section on ITF Taekwondo Patterns.\n\nBe aware that in 2017, the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) changed its name to World Taekwondo (WT). This has led to a little confusion regarding WTF versus WT forms but they are the same thing. The forms were not changed. The organization simply changed its name in order to avoid the negative connotation associated with “WTF”.\n\nMost WT Taekwondo schools use Taegeuk forms for the color belt levels. However, before the current Taegeuk forms were adopted, the WT used Palgwe forms. Therefore, there are still some Taekwondo schools that use the older Palgwe forms. Please check with your instructor to see your Taekwondo school uses Taegeuk forms (listed below) or Palgwe Forms.",
