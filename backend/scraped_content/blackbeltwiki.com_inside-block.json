  "description": "Martial Arts Inside Block\n\nThis page will show you how to do a martial arts inside block. This block is also known as an inwards block or an outside to inside block. However, be aware that some martial arts styles (i.e. Shotokan Karate) call this an outside block (because it is going from out to in).\n\nWith an inside block, martial arts students bring their forearm “inside” across their faces or body (from the outside to inside) in order to block an opponent’s attack. For more blocking techniques, please visit Black Belt Wiki’s main Martial Arts Blocks section.",
