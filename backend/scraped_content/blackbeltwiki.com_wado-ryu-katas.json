  "description": "These pages provide instructions & videos for Wado-Ryu kata so you can get ready for your next belt test. However, if you have any questions about a particular kata movement or sequence, please check with your Karate instructor because kata instructions can vary by school and organization.\n\nIn order to understand the Wado-Ryu Karate kata, you need to know that “Wado” means the way of peace and harmony and “Ryu” means school. This basic philosophy stands behind the movements in the various Wado-Ryu Karate kata. You should also read our section on Is Kata Useful or Useless? It discusses the pros & cons of kata. For the katas of other Karate styles (i.e. Shotokan katas), please visit the main Katas & Forms section.\n\nWiki – Best Karate Books",
