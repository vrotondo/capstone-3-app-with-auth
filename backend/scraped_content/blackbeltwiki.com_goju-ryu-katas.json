  "description": "This page will help you to learn the Goju-Ryu katas so you can get ready for your next belt test. However, if you have any questions about a particular kata movement, please check with your instructor because kata instructions and the order of katas can vary by school and organization. Students should also know Goju-Ryu kata meanings as this is often part of a belt test.\n\nThere are 12 official “core” katas for Goju-Ryu. However, the Sanchin kata is occasionally separated into two katas by some schools. Therefore, people are sometimes confused and think there are 13 Goju-Ryu katas. In addition, some Goju-Ryu schools and organizations borrow katas from other styles and they might use more than the official 12 katas. For the katas of other Karate styles (i.e. Shotokan Kata), please visit the main Katas & Forms section.\n\nTaikyoku Kata – Click on pages below for kata videos and/or written instructions",
