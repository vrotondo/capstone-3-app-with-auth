  "description": "This page provides details on the martial arts roundhouse kick. This kick is also known as a round kick. The roundhouse kick is used in many different martial arts styles such as Taekwondo (where the kick is known as Dollyo Chagi), Karate (Mawashi Geri), Muay Thai (Tae Tud), Mixed Martial Arts and Kickboxing. For information on other martial arts kicks (i.e. spinning hook kick), please visit Black Belt Wiki’s main section on Martial Arts Kicks.\n\nA roundhouse kick is one of the most commonly used kicks in martial arts due to its speed, decent power, range and ease of use. It can also be used against a variety of targets. For example, a roundhouse kick can be targeted low (i.e. against the knee) where it can not be caught, chest high for sparring matches (i.e. aiming for the targets on Taekwondo chest protectors) or head high (but the martial artist needs to be very flexible and runs the risk of the opponent grabbing their leg).\n\nMartial arts kicks and all other martial arts techniques should only be practiced under the supervision of a trained martial arts instructor in order to prevent injuries and to ensure the proper technique is utilized. In addition, all martial arts techniques and training should be used safely and responsibly.",
