  "description": "This page provides written & video instructions for the 26 main Shotokan katas. It has information on Shotokan kihon katas. In addition, this section explores the meaning of each Shotokan Karate kata because many Shotokan schools question their students about these kata meanings during belt tests. For information on the katas of other Karate styles (i.e. Wado-Ryu katas or Kyokushin katas), please visit the main Black Belt Wiki section on Katas & Forms.\n\nInstructional Books – Shotokan Books\n\nShotokan Kihon Katas – These introductory kihon katas are used by some Shotokan schools.
