  "variations": "• The martial artist will step forward in order to gain momentum and to get closer to the target.\n• They will turn/spin their body backwards until they are facing directly away from the target. For example, if they have stepped forward with their right foot, their body will spin counter clockwise.\n• They will continue turning and look over their shoulder (looking at the target).\n• The martial artist will lift their knee to their chest (think of kicking like a mule).\n• They will drive the heel of their foot straight back towards the opponent.\n• Best Books – Visitor favorites!\n• Aikido Books\n• BJJ & Judo Books\n• Flexibility & Stretching Books\n• Karate Books",
