  "description": "Martial Arts Outside Block\n\nThis page will show you how to do a martial arts outside block. This block is also known as an in-to-out block. However, be aware that some martial arts styles (i.e. Shotokan Karate) call this technique an inside block (because the block starts from the inside before going outwards).\n\nWith an outside block, martial arts students moves their arm away (from the inside to outside) from their head or body in order to block an opponent’s high kick or punch. For more blocking techniques, please visit Black belt Wiki’s main Martial Arts Blocks section.",
