  "description": "This page provides information on the martial arts hammer fist (or hammer strike). In this martial arts technique, martial arts students will swing their clenched fist downwards to the target (i.e. an attacker’s nose). For information on other punches and hand/arm strikes (i.e. knife hand strikes & haymaker punches), please visit Black Belt Wiki’s main Punches & Strikes section.\n\nThis strike can be safer for a martial arts student’s hand because they are hitting a target with the “padded” bottom of a clenched fist. Thus there is a lower chance that a student will break their hand or knuckles with this strike.\n\nMartial arts punches & strikes and all other martial arts techniques should only be practiced under the supervision of a trained martial arts instructor.",
