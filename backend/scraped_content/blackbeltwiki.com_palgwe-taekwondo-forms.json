  "description": "This page provides free instructions for Taekwondo Palgwe forms so you can get ready for your next Taekwondo belt test. It covers Palgwe forms 1 through 8. FYI – Palgwe color belt forms are not part of the official curriculum for WTF or ITF Taekwondo schools. Palgwe forms were used before the WTF (World Taekwondo Federation) switched to Taegeuk forms. Nevertheless, Palgwe is still used at many Taekwondo schools. However, please be aware that while Palgwe forms have similar names to the color belt WTF Taegeuk forms (i.e. Sam Jang), they are completely different Taekwondo forms. Check with your Taekwondo instructor to see if your school uses Palgwe or Taegeuk Taekwondo forms.\n\nPalgwe Forms 1-8 – Click on the forms below for videos and/or written instructions.\n\nFor the meaning of these forms, please visit the Meaning of Taekwondo Palgwe Forms. Moreover, after Palgwe form 8, students who have learned the Palgwe forms for their color belts generally switch to the Taekwondo Black Belt Forms (i.e. Koryo) used by World Taekwondo (WT).",
