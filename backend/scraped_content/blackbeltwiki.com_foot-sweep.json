  "description": "Foot & leg sweeps are an effective way to knock over an opponent. They are used in many martial arts such as Judo and Karate. Sweeps often employ a kick or grappling technique to strike one or both legs of an opponent in order to cause the opponent to lose their balance and fall to the ground. The attacker can then grapple, kick or strike the fallen opponent who will be in a disadvantageous position and possibly stunned by the fall.\n\nFoot & leg sweeps are also often used in martial arts movies. For example, a classic scene from The Karate Kid is where the evil Cobra Kai sensei instructs his student to “sweep the leg” of Daniel-san.\n\nAll martial arts techniques should only be practiced under the supervision of a trained martial arts instructor in order to prevent injuries and to ensure the proper technique is utilized. In addition, all martial arts techniques should be used safely and responsibly.",
