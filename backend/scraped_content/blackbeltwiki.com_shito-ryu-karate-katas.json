  "description": "This page examines Shito-Ryu Karate kata. It provides videos and/or written instructions for the color belt and black belt katas used in Shito-Ryu Karate (i.e. Pinan Shodan, Naifanchin Shodan, Juroku, etc.). However, if you have any questions about a particular Shito-Ryu kata movement, please check with your instructor. Shito-Ryu is famous for having the most katas of the major styles of Karate.\n\nAfter the death of Kenwa Mabuni (the founder of Shito-Ryu) in 1958, Shito-Ryu fragmented into differing associations and school systems. This has led to different organizations using different katas and having the kata in different orders. Check with your instructors to find out what Shito-Ryu kata are taught at your school. Therefore, if you are looking for International Hayashi-Ha Shito-Ryu katas, please visit the Black Belt Wiki’s International Hayashi-Ha Shito-Ryu Kata section. For the kata of other Karate styles (i.e. Shotokan katas), please visit Black Belt Wiki’s main Katas & Forms section.\n\nList of Shito-Ryu Karate Katas",
