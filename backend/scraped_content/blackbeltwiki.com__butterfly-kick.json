  "description": "This page provides details on the martial arts butterfly kick. The butterfly kick is an acrobatic kicking technique used in martial arts such as Kung Fu. A more advanced version of the butterfly kick is the butterfly twist kick. Given this kick’s spectacular spinning motion, it is often used in martial arts demonstrations. For information on other martial arts kicks, please visit Black Belt Wiki’s main kicking techniques page.\n\nThe butterfly kick has evolved into mainly a demonstration kick because if the martial artist doesn’t hit an opponent perfectly, they are likely to land very awkwardly (possibly injuring themselves or sprawled out on the ground). Since it is a flying and twisting kick, the butterfly kick is very hard to control and would be difficult to employ well in a self-defense situation. In breaking demonstrations, martial artists usually use their heel to strike a target with a butterfly kick.\n\nMartial arts kicks and all other martial arts techniques should only be practiced under the supervision of a trained martial arts instructor in order to prevent injuries and to ensure the proper technique is utilized. In addition, all martial arts techniques and training should be used safely and responsibly.",
