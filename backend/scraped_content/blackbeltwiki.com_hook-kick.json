  "description": "This page provides details on the martial arts hook kick or whip kick. This can be a deceptive kick because the kick appears to miss the target before snapping back and hitting with the heel of the foot. Moreover, this technique is used as part of the more powerful spinning hook kick. For information on other martial arts kicks (i.e. axe kick), please visit Black Belt Wiki’s main kicking techniques page.\n\nMartial arts kicks and all other martial arts techniques should only be practiced under the supervision of a trained martial arts instructor in order to prevent injuries and to ensure the proper technique is utilized. In addition, all martial arts techniques and training should be used safely and responsibly.\n\nWritten Kicking Instructions",
