  "description": "This page provides free video and written instructions for all of the ITF Taekwondo patterns 1 through 24. These color belt and black belt Taekwondo patterns are used by the International Taekwondo Federation (ITF), one of the two largest Taekwondo organizations. If you are looking for the “forms” used by World Taekwondo (the other main Taekwondo organization), please go to the Black Belt Wiki section on Taekwondo Forms. Be aware that students are also frequently tested on the meaning of each ITF pattern. Therefore, you should also visit the Black Belt Wiki section focused on the meaning of ITF patterns in order to prep for a belt test.\n\nInstructional Books – Taekwondo Books\n\nITF Taekwondo Preparatory Exercises – These exercises are often used in order to prepare beginning students for the traditional ITF patterns (i.e. Chon-Ji).",
