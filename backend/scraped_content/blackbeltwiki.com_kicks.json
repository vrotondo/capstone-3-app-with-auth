  "description": "This page provides details on a huge variety of martial arts kicks such as the axe kick, spinning hook kick and flying back kick. It also provides videos and/or written instructions for each of the kicks listed below in order to help martial artists to learn more about specific martial arts kicking techniques. Martial arts kicks are often practiced extensively by martial artists because they are used in a wide range of different situations including self-defense, sparring, katas & forms, breaking techniques and demonstrations. Given the skill and flexibility required, many of the more advanced kicks (i.e. spinning hook kick and butterfly kick) are also used in martial arts movies in order to show the movie hero’s mastery of the martial arts.\n\nKicking techniques can be done either with bare feet or with martial arts shoes. Some martial arts styles even practice kicks with street shoes (as a martial artist is unlikely to find themselves wearing martial arts shoes or walking around with bare feet in a self-defense situation). For additional kicking information, you should also visit the Black Belt Wiki sections on leg flexibility (necessary for high kicks), leg strength, kicking power, kicking speed and knee strikes.\n\nMartial arts kicks and all other martial arts techniques should only be practiced under the supervision of a trained martial arts instructor in order to prevent injuries and to ensure the proper technique is utilized. In addition, all martial arts techniques and training should be used safely and responsibly.",
