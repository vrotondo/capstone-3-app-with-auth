  "description": "This page looks at Tang Soo Do forms (hyung). It provides instructions & form videos to help prepare you for your next Tang Soo Do belt test. Hyung (forms) are used in Tang Soo Do in order to practice certain martial arts techniques (i.e. kicking combinations) as well as for conditioning purposes, muscle memory, focus/concentration, etc. However, be aware that many Tang Soo Do schools add extra forms (hyung) to their curriculum, have their forms (hyung) in different orders/sequences and occasionally modify existing forms (hyung). In addition, schools belonging to different Tang Soo Do associations have different form (hyung) requirements. Therefore, please check with your instructor for the proper techniques and forms (hyung) used at your school. FYI – While many schools start with the Ki Cho forms, World Tang Soo Do Association schools start with Sae Kye Hyung (located near the middle of this page).\n\nTang Soo Do Hyung or Forms – Videos & Written Instructions\n\nWorld Tang Soo Do Association Forms (Hyung) – Initial color belt forms use Sae Kye versus non-WTSDA schools that use Ki Cho.",
