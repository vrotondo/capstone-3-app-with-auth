  "description": "This page provides details on the martial arts downward roundhouse kick. This kick is also called as the “Brazilian Kick”. In Karate, the downward roundhouse kick is known as Otoshi Mawashi Geri. For information on other martial arts kicks (i.e. spinning hook kick), please visit Black Belt Wiki’s main Martial Arts Kicking Techniques section.\n\nThe downward roundhouse kick is like a traditional roundhouse kick but where you angle your kick downwards towards your target (versus laterally in a traditional roundhouse). Martial artists need to be very flexible in order to throw a downward roundhouse effectively.\n\nMartial arts kicks and all other martial arts techniques should only be practiced under the supervision of a trained martial arts instructor in order to prevent injuries and to ensure the proper technique is utilized. In addition, all martial arts techniques and training should be used safely and responsibly.",
