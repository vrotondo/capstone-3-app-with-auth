  "description": "This page provides details on the martial arts double front kick or jumping double front kick. This is an advanced version of the traditional front kick and should not be confused with a jumping front kick. The jumping double front kick is used mainly for demonstration kicks, breaking techniques and in martial arts movies. It is not very effective for self-defense or sparring. For information on other martial arts kicks (i.e. spinning hook kick), please visit Black Belt Wiki’s main kicking techniques section.\n\nMartial arts kicks and all other martial arts techniques should only be practiced under the supervision of a trained martial arts instructor in order to prevent injuries and to ensure the proper technique is utilized. In addition, all martial arts techniques and training should be used safely and responsibly.\n\nVideos on the Double Front Kick",
