  "description": "This page provides information on the martial arts jab or “jab punch”. The jab is often a quick but less powerful punch used to keep an opponent off-balance, at a distance and/or on the defensive. In contrast, a straight punch or reverse punch takes more time to connect (as it has to travel a longer distance) but it is a more powerful punch often used by martial artists for knockouts. For more punches and hand/arm strikes (i.e. straight punch, hammer strike and spinning back fist), please visit Black Belt Wiki’s main Punches & Strikes section.\n\nMartial arts punches & strikes and all other martial arts techniques should only be practiced under the supervision of a trained martial arts instructor.\n\nInstructional Videos on Jabs",
