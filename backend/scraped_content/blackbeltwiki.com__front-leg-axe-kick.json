  "variations": "• This kick focuses on raising a front leg vertically as high as a person can and then bringing the leg down against a target (i.e. practice pad or an opponent).\n• A front leg axe kick is more difficult than a rear leg axe kick because a martial artist needs to be more flexible. With the rear leg axe kick, a martial artists raises their rear leg and use the rotation of their hips in order to increase the height for the kick. In contrast, the front leg axe kick, the martial artist only has to bring the leg straight up.\n• The front leg axe kick is often combined with a skip or slide because a martial artist needs room in order to raise their leg without it being blocked by their opponent’s body.\n• Martial artists try to strike the target with the heel of their foot. The hard bone of the heel is more effective than striking with the sole or ball of the foot.\n• In self-defense, this kick can be used against targets such as the face or shoulder bone of an attacker.\n• Axe Kick – Rear leg axe kick\n• Jumping Axe Kick\n• Jumping Spinning Axe Kick (or Tornado Axe Kick)\n• Skipping Axe Kick\n• Best Books – Visitor favorites!\n• Aikido Books\n• BJJ & Judo Books\n• Flexibility & Stretching Books\n• Karate Books",
