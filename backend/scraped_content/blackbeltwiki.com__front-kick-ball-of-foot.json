While a front kick is a very basic kick, it is useful for self-defense situations such as kicking an attacker in the groin. For information on other martial arts kicks (i.e. spinning hook kick), please visit Black Belt Wiki’s main kicking techniques page.\n\nA front kick that strikes with the ball of the foot is most commonly used in martial arts such as Karate. In Karate, a front kick is known as Mae Geri.

In addition, all martial arts techniques and training should be used safely and responsibly.",
