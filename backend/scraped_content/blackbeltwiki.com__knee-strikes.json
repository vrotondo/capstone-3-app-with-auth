  "description": "This section provides details on a wide variety of martial arts knee strikes. These techniques are utilized by martial artists in many close range situations. While knee strikes are not allowed in some martial arts sparring matches for safety reasons, they are used extensively in sparring by many other martial arts such as Muay Thai. If you are looking for information on kicking techniques (i.e. spinning hook kicks), please visit Black Belt Wiki’s main section on Martial Arts Kicking Techniques.\n\nGiven the shorter range of knee strikes (versus kicks and punches), this technique is often combined with clinching or holding the attacker so he can not escape and move outside the limited range of the knee strike. Self-defense targets for a knee strike include the attacker’s head/chin, ribs, groin, quad muscles, etc.\n\nMartial arts knee strikes and all other martial arts techniques should only be practiced under the supervision of a trained martial arts instructor in order to prevent injuries and to ensure the proper technique is utilized. In addition, all martial arts techniques and training should be used safely and responsibly.",
