  "description": "This page provides details on the martial arts crescent kick. The crescent kick is used by many different martial arts styles. For example, the crescent kick is known as Bandal Chagi in Taekwondo and Mikazuki Geri in Karate. For more information on other martial arts kicks (i.e. spinning hook kick), please visit Black Belt Wiki’s main section on Martial Arts Kicks.\n\nWhile there are a variety of crescent kicks (see below), the most basic crescent kicks are the Inside Crescent Kick (in-to-out crescent kick) and the Outside Crescent Kick (out-to-in crescent kick). A crescent kick can strike an opponent with the edge of the foot or the heel of the foot in a “crescent axe kick” hybrid variation.\n\nMartial arts kicks and all other martial arts techniques should only be practiced under the supervision of a trained martial arts instructor in order to prevent injuries and to ensure the proper technique is utilized. In addition, all martial arts techniques and training should be used safely and responsibly.",
