However, if you have any questions about a particular kata movement, please check with your instructor because kata instructions and the order of katas can vary by school and organization. There are a variety of Isshin-Ryu katas including “empty hand” kata (no martial arts weapons involved) and weapons kata that use either the Bo staff, Sai or Tonfa.\n\nYou should also read our section on Is Kata Useful or Useless? It discusses the pros & cons of kata. For the katas of other Karate styles (i.e. Shotokan katas), please visit the main Katas & Forms section.\n\nWiki – Best Karate Books",
