To master these Kyokushin Karate katas, you will also have to learn basic Kyokushin stances. In order to pass your belt tests, many Kyokushin schools also require that you know the meanings of Kyokushin kata. Please check with your Sensei/Instructor regarding your required kata movements as some Kyokushin Karate schools use slightly different kata formats. In addition, a number of Kyokushin Karate schools have their kata in different orders/sequences based on the preference of the school’s Sensei and system. For information on the katas of other Karate styles (i.e. Shotokan katas), please visit the main Katas & Forms section.\n\nInstructional Books – Martial Arts Books\n\nList of Kyokushin Karate Katas – includes videos and/or written instructions",
