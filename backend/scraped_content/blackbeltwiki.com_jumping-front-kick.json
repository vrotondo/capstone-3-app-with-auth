  "description": "This page provides details on the martial arts Jumping Front Kick. This martial arts kick is a more advanced version of the traditional front kick. For information on other martial arts kicks (i.e. spinning hook kick), please visit Black Belt Wiki’s main Martial Arts Kicks page.\n\nThis technique allows martial artists to achieve higher jumps so they can attack taller opponents with a front kick (i.e. target the attacker’s chin). This type of kick is also used for breaking demonstrations by a number of martial arts styles (i.e. Taekwondo).\n\nMartial arts kicks and all other martial arts techniques should only be practiced under the supervision of a trained martial arts instructor in order to prevent injuries and to ensure the proper technique is utilized. In addition, all martial arts techniques and training should be used safely and responsibly.",
