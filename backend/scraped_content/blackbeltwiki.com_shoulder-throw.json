We have also included informational videos from other martial arts (such as Judo) that utilize shoulder throws more extensively. For information on other Krav Maga techniques (i.e. punches, kicks & grappling), please visit Black Belt Wiki’s main Krav Maga Techniques section.\n\nThis information is meant to supplement what is taught at Krav Maga schools. To properly understand these techniques, you need to learn them from a certified Krav Maga instructor who can give an in-depth explanation of the technique, correct your mistakes and detail how the technique should be utilized. All martial arts techniques should only be practiced under the supervision of a trained martial arts instructor in order to prevent injuries and to ensure the proper technique is utilized. In addition, all martial arts techniques and training should be used safely and responsibly.\n\nKrav Maga Video on Shoulder Throws",
